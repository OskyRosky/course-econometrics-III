# Econometrics III – Microeconometrics

Advanced econometrics

## 1. Course Overview

Econometrics III, formally titled Microeconometrics, is an advanced applied course focused on the econometric analysis of cross-sectional economic data. The course represents a logical continuation of the econometrics sequence and provides students with the methodological foundations required to analyze individual-level and firm-level economic behavior.

The course emphasizes model building, estimation, diagnostics, and interpretation of econometric results, with strong attention to real-world economic applications and professional analytical standards.

## 2. Course Objectives

The main objective of this course is to train students to formulate, estimate, evaluate, and interpret econometric models for microeconomic data.

Specifically, the course aims to:

	•	Develop solid foundations in linear and generalized regression models.
	•	Apply econometric techniques to cross-sectional economic data.
	•	Understand the assumptions underlying econometric models and their implications.
	•	Diagnose model violations and apply appropriate remedial measures.
	•	Analyze qualitative and limited dependent variables.
	•	Use statistical software (R) for applied economic data analysis.
	•	Strengthen analytical reasoning and economic interpretation skills.

## 3. Linear Regression Models

The course begins with a rigorous treatment of linear regression models:

	•	Simple linear regression and bivariate analysis.
	•	Difference between correlation and regression.
	•	Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation.
	•	Interpretation of regression coefficients.
	•	Coefficient of determination (R²).
	•	Hypothesis testing of regression parameters.

The analysis then extends to multiple linear regression, including:

	•	Matrix algebra foundations.
	•	Multivariate regression analysis.
	•	OLS and Maximum Likelihood estimation.
	•	Hypothesis testing in multiple regression contexts.
	•	Interpretation of goodness-of-fit measures and sums of squares.

## 4. Model Selection and Diagnostic Analysis

A core component of the course focuses on evaluating and improving econometric models:

	•	Estimation and comparison of multiple regression specifications.
	•	Goodness-of-fit and model performance measures.
	•	Information criteria for model selection.
	•	Assumptions of the classical linear regression model.
	•	Diagnostic tests for:
	•	Normality
	•	Homoscedasticity
	•	Multicollinearity
	•	Residual behavior
	•	Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
	•	Discussion on the practical relevance of model assumptions.

## 5. Remedial Measures and Advanced Regression Topics

When model assumptions are violated, the course introduces corrective techniques:

	•	Purpose and interpretation of remedial measures.
	•	Variable transformations.
	•	Weighted least squares and residual weighting.
	•	Ridge regression for multicollinearity.

The course also covers extensions of regression models, including:

	•	Regression with qualitative independent variables.
	•	Interpretation of dummy variables and interaction effects.
	•	k−1 regression lines and group comparisons.

## 6. Limited Dependent Variable Models

An important section of the course focuses on models where the dependent variable is not continuous:

	•	Regression with dichotomous dependent variables.
	•	Logit regression models.
	•	Probit regression models.
	•	Interpretation of coefficients and marginal effects.
	•	Applications to economic decision-making and classification problems.

These models are essential for applied microeconomic analysis in labor economics, finance, marketing, and public policy.

## 7. Applied Econometrics Using R

The course integrates theory with hands-on computational analysis using R and RStudio:

	•	Introduction to R and the RStudio environment.
	•	Importing and exporting datasets.
	•	Data transformation and preprocessing.
	•	Table creation and data summaries.
	•	Graphical visualization for economic analysis.
	•	Use of R Markdown for reproducible research and reporting.

R is treated as a professional analytical tool for econometric modeling and communication of results.

## 8. Teaching Methodology and Evaluation

The course follows a flipped classroom methodology, emphasizing active learning:

	•	Conceptual content is studied independently.
	•	Classroom sessions focus on application, analysis, and discussion.
	•	Group-based case studies on real economic contexts.
	•	Continuous practical exercises and applied assignments.

Evaluation is based on:

	•	Applied economic case studies.
	•	Guided econometric exercises in R.
	•	Practical assignments and presentations.
	•	A final research project integrating econometric modeling and interpretation.
